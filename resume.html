    <h2>Resume FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>How long should my resume be?</strong><br>
        For most UMSI students and new grads, one page is best. More experienced professionals may require two pages.
      </li>
        <strong>Do I need a different resume for each application?</strong><br>
        It’s wise to tailor your resume to the requirements and keywords of each opportunity. It's good to have a "master" resume template for referance/job fairs,etc. but don't send that out for a specific role. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Is it okay to include coursework or student projects?</strong><br>
        Absolutely! UMSI coursework and projects are valued by employers, especially if they show relevant skills and impact.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How often should I update my resume?</strong><br>
        Update your resume every semester, after major projects, or whenever you gain a new role or responsibility. The CDO office can help you showcase your projects on your resume.
