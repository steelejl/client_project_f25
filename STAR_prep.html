		<p>STAR is an acronym for Story, Task, Action and Result. This is a useful tool that helps shape </br>
            your interview into succint responses to the questions. You can think of it like you are </br>
            a skilled storyteller and each response conveys a specific message that highlights who </br> 
            are as a professional. </p>
